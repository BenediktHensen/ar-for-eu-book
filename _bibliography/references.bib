 abstract = {In complex networks it is common for each node to belong to several communities, implying a highly overlapping community structure. Recent advances in benchmarking indicate that existing community assignment algorithms that are capable of detecting overlapping communities perform well only when the extent of community overlap is kept to modest levels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new community assignment algorithm called Greedy Clique Expansion (GCE). The algorithm identifies distinct cliques as seeds and expands these seeds by greedily optimizing a local fitness function. We perform extensive benchmarks on synthetic data to demonstrate that GCE's good performance is robust across diverse graph topologies. Significantly, GCE is the only algorithm to perform well on these synthetic graphs, in which every node belongs to multiple communities. Furthermore, when put to the task of identifying functional modules in protein interaction data, and college dorm assignments in Facebook friendship data, we find that GCE performs competitively.},

@article{XinGangLi.2007,
 abstract = {Complex networks are constructed in the evolution process of traffic flow, and the states of traffic flow are represented by nodes in the network. The traffic dynamics can then be studied by investigating the statistical properties of those networks. According to Kerner's three-phase theory, there are two different phases in congested traffic, synchronized flow and wide moving jam. In the framework of this theory, we study different properties of synchronized flow and moving jam in relation to complex network. Scale-free network is constructed in stop-and-go traffic, i.e., a sequence of moving jams [Chin. Phys. Lett. 10, 2711 (2005)]. In this work, the networks generated in synchronized flow are investigated in detail. Simulation results show that the degree distribution of the networks constructed in synchronized flow has two power law regions, so the distinction in topological structure can really reflect the different dynamics in traffic flow. Furthermore, the real traffic data are investigated by this method, and the results are consistent with the simulations.},

@article{X.S.Zhang.2009,
 abstract = {Detecting community structure in complex networks is a fundamental but challenging topic in network science. Modularity measures, such as widely used modularity function Q and recently suggested modularity density D, play critical roles as quality indices in partitioning a network into communities. In this letter, we reveal the complex behaviors of modularity optimization under different community definitions by an analytic study. Surprisingly, we find that in addition to the resolution limit of Q revealed in a recent study, both Q and D suffer from a more serious limitation, i.e. some derived communities do not satisfy the weak community definition or even the most weak community definition. Especially, the latter case, called as misidentification, implies that these communities may have sparser connection within them than between them, which violates the basic intuitive sense for a subgraph to be a community. Using a discrete convex optimization framework, we investigate the underlying causes for these limitations and provide insights on choices of the modularity measures in applications. Numerical experiments on artificial and real-life networks confirm the theoretical analysis.},

@article{Ginestra.2009,
 abstract = {Networks describe a variety of interacting complex systems in social science, biology, and information technology. Usually the nodes of real networks are identified not only by their connections but also by some other characteristics. Examples of characteristics of nodes can be age, gender, or nationality of a person in a social network, the abundance of proteins in the cell taking part in protein-interaction networks, or the geographical position of airports that are connected by directed flights. Integrating the information on the connections of each node with the information about its characteristics is crucial to discriminating between the essential and negligible characteristics of nodes for the structure of the network. In this paper we propose a general indicator \textgreek{J}, based on entropy measures, to quantify the dependence of a network's structure on a given set of features. We apply this method to social networks of friendships in U.S. schools, to the protein-interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to the U.S. airport network, showing that the proposed measure provides information that complements other known measures.},

@article{ABLe10,
 abstract = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society1, 2, 3. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities4, 5: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes6, 7 or social spheres8, 9, 10. Communities in networks often overlap9, 10 such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure11, 12, 13. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein--protein interaction6, 7, 14 and metabolic networks11, 15, 16, and show that a large social network10, 17, 18 contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.},

Of the cluster recovery indices prominent in contemporary literature, the Hubert and Arabie (1985) adjustment to the Rand index (1971) has been demonstrated to have the most desirable properties (Milligan {\&} Cooper, 1986). However, use of the Hubert and Arabie adjustment to the Rand index is limited to cluster solutions involving non-overlapping, or disjoint, clusters. The present paper introduces a generalization of the Hubert and Arabie adjusted Rand index. This generalization, called the Omega index, can be applied to situations where both, one, or neither of the solutions being compared is non-disjoint. In the special case where both solutions are disjoint, the Omega index is equivalent to the Hubert and Arabie adjusted Rand index.},

 abstract = {Community structure is an important property of the complex networks. How to detect the communities is significant to understand the network structure and analyze the network properties. Many algorithms, such as K-L and GN, have been proposed to detect the community structure in complex networks. However, the communities detected by these algorithms are always not overlapping. According to daily experience, a node in the network may belong to several communities and a community should have many nodes and connections. Based on these principals and existing researches, an efficient algorithm for overlapping community detection in complex networks is proposed in this paper. The key strategy of the algorithm is to mine a node with the closest relations with the community and assign it to the community. Some real-world networks are used to test the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed is rather efficient to detect the overlapping community in complex networks.},

@article{DYB*11b,
 abstract = {The detection of overlapping communities in complex networks has motivated recent research in relevant fields. Aiming to address this problem, we propose a Markov-dynamics-based algorithm, called UEOC, which means 'unfold and extract overlapping communities'. In UEOC, when identifying each natural community that overlaps, a Markov random walk method combined with a constraint strategy, which is based on the corresponding annealed network (degree conserving random network), is performed to unfold the community. Then, a cutoff criterion with the aid of a local community function, called conductance, which can be thought of as the ratio between the number of edges inside the community and those leaving it, is presented to extract this emerged community from the entire network. The UEOC algorithm depends on only one parameter whose value can be easily set, and it requires no prior knowledge of the hidden community structures. The proposed UEOC has been evaluated both on synthetic benchmarks and on some real-world networks, and has been compared with a set of competing algorithms. The experimental result has shown that UEOC is highly effective and efficient for discovering overlapping communities.},

@article{EsHa09,
 abstract = {We use the concept of the network communicability [E. Estrada, N. Hatano, Communicability in complex networks, Phys. Rev. E 77 (2008) 036111] to define communities in a complex network. The communities are defined as the cliques of a {\dq}communicability graph{\dq}, which has the same set of nodes as the complex network and links determined by the communicability function. Then, the problem of finding the network communities is transformed to an all-clique problem of the communicability graph. We discuss the efficiency of this algorithm of community detection. In addition, we extend here the concept of the communicability to account for the strength of the interactions between the nodes by using the concept of inverse temperature of the network. Finally, we develop an algorithm to manage the different degrees of overlapping between the communities in a complex network. We then analyze the USA airport network, for which we successfully detect two big communities of the eastern airports and of the western/central airports as well as two bridging central communities. In striking contrast, a well-known algorithm groups all but two of the continental airports into one community. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Weighted line graphs are argued to provide an alternative, valuable representation of the system's topology, and are shown to have important applications in community detection, as the usual node partition of a line graph naturally leads to an edge partition of the original graph. This identification allows us to use traditional partitioning methods in order to address the long-standing problem of the detection of overlapping communities.

@article{FWR*12,
 abstract = {With rapid advances in the development of DNA sequencing technologies, a plethora of high-throughput genome and proteome data from a diverse spectrum of organisms have been generated. The functional annotation and evolutionary history of proteins are usually inferred from domains predicted from the genome sequences. Traditional database-based domain prediction methods cannot identify novel domains, however, and alignment-based methods, which look for recurring segments in the proteome, are computationally demanding. Here, we propose a novel genome-wide domain prediction method, SECOM. Instead of conducting all-against-all sequence alignment, SECOM first indexes all the proteins in the genome by using a hash seed function. Local similarity can thus be detected and encoded into a graph structure, in which each node represents a protein sequence and each edge weight represents the shared hash seeds between the two nodes. SECOM then formulates the domain prediction problem as an overlapping community-finding problem in this graph. A backward graph percolation algorithm that efficiently identifies the domains is proposed. We tested SECOM on five recently sequenced genomes of aquatic animals. Our tests demonstrated that SECOM was able to identify most of the known domains identified by InterProScan. When compared with the alignment-based method, SECOM showed higher sensitivity in detecting putative novel domains, while it was also three orders of magnitude faster. For example, SECOM was able to predict a novel sponge-specific domain in nucleoside-triphosphatase (NTPases). Furthermore, SECOM discovered two novel domains, likely of bacterial origin, that are taxonomically restricted to sea anemone and hydra. SECOM is an open-source program and available at http://sfb.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Software.aspx.},

We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries.

 abstract = {We propose a new local, deterministic and parameter-free algorithm that detects fuzzy and crisp overlapping communities in a weighted network and simultaneously reveals their hierarchy. Using a local fitness function, the algorithm greedily expands natural communities of seeds until the whole graph is covered. The hierarchy of communities is obtained analytically by calculating resolution levels at which communities grow rather than numerically by testing different resolution levels. This analytic procedure is not only more exact than its numerical alternatives such as LFM and GCE but also much faster. Critical resolution levels can be identified by searching for intervals in which large changes of the resolution do not lead to growth of communities. We tested our algorithm on benchmark graphs and on a network of 492 papers in information science. Combined with a specific post-processing, the algorithm gives much more precise results on LFR benchmarks with high overlap compared to other algorithms and performs very similar to GCE.},

@article{HSHF11,
 abstract = {The investigation of community structure in networks is an important issue in many disciplines, which still remains a challenging task. First, complex networks often show a hierarchical structure with communities embedded within other communities. Moreover, communities in the network may overlap and have noise, e.g., some nodes belonging to multiple communities and some nodes marginally connected with the communities, which are called hub and outlier, respectively. Therefore, a good algorithm is desirable to be able to not only detect hierarchical communities, but also to identify hubs and outliers. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free hierarchical network clustering algorithm DenShrink. By combining the advantages of density-based clustering and modularity optimization methods, our algorithm can reveal the embedded hierarchical community structure efficiently in large-scale weighted undirected networks, and identify hubs and outliers as well. Moreover, it overcomes the resolution limit possessed by other modularity-based methods. Our experiments on the real-world and synthetic datasets show that DenShrink generates more accurate results than the baseline methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Many complex networks display a mesoscopic structure with groups of nodes sharing many links with the other nodes in their group and comparatively few with nodes of different groups. This feature is known as community structure and encodes precious information about the organization and the function of the nodes. Many algorithms have been proposed but it is not yet clear how they should be tested. Recently we have proposed a general class of undirected and unweighted benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size. An increasing attention has been recently devoted to develop algorithms able to consider the direction and the weight of the links, which require suitable benchmark graphs for testing. In this paper we extend the basic ideas behind our previous benchmark to generate directed and weighted networks with built-in community structure. We also consider the possibility that nodes belong to more communities, a feature occurring in real systems, such as social networks. As a practical application, we show how modularity optimization performs on our benchmark.},

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes.

 abstract = {The Potts model was used to uncover community structure in complex networks. However, it could not reveal much important information such as the optimal number of communities and the overlapping nodes hidden in networks effectively. Differently from the previous studies, we established a new framework to study the dynamics of Potts model for community structure detection by using the Markov process, which has a clear mathematic explanation. Based on our framework, we showed that the local uniform behavior of spin values could naturally reveal the hierarchical community structure of a given network. Critical topological information regarding the optimal community structure could also be inferred from spectral signatures of the Markov process. A two-stage algorithm to detect community structure is developed. The effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm has been theoretically analyzed as well as experimentally validated.

Our method for the first time optimizes the topological entropy of a network and uncovers communities through a novel dynamic system converging to a local minimum by simply updating the membership vector with very low computational complexity. It naturally supports overlapping communities through associating each node with a membership vector which describes node's involvement in each community. Furthermore, different multi-scale partitions can be obtained by tuning the characteristic size of modules from the optimal partition. Because of the high efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm, it is feasible to be used for the accurate detection of community structures in real networks.},

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g. `circles ' on Google+, and `lists ' on Facebook and Twitter), however they are laborious to construct and must be updated whenever a user's network grows. We define a novel machine learning task of identifying users ' social circles. We pose the problem as a node clustering problem on a user's ego-network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles.

One of the most important and prominent ideas from network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly-connected groups of nodes known as communities. Here we develop a formulation to detect communities in a very broad setting by studying general dynamical processes on networks. We create a new framework of network quality functions that allows us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through additional links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices.

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

 abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

A good algorithm for community detection should not only quantify the topology of the network but incorporate the dynamical processes that take place on the network. We present an algorithm for community detection that combines network structure with processes that support the creation and/or evolution of communities. The algorithm does not embrace the universal approach but instead tries to focus on social networks and model dynamic social interactions that occur on those networks. It identifies leaders and communities that form around those leaders. It naturally supports overlapping communities by associating each node with a membership vector that describes the node's involvement in each community. This way, in addition to the overlapping communities, we can identify nodes that are good followers of their leader and also nodes with no clear community involvement that serve as proxies between several communities and that are equally as important. We run the algorithm for several real social networks which we believe represent a good fraction of the wide body of social networks and discuss the results, including other possible applications.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient method for adjusting these classical algorithms to match the requirement for discovering overlapping communities in complex networks, which is based on a local definition of community strength. The method can in principle be applied with any clustering algorithm. Tests on a set of computer generated and real-world networks give excellent results. In particular, we show that the method can also allow one to availably analyze the problem of unstable nodes in community detection, which is very helpful for understanding the structural properties of the networks correctly and comprehensively.

Through our analysis on modularity, we deduce that, to become an overlapping node without demolishing modularity, nodes should satisfy a specific condition presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm outputs high quality overlapping communities by efficiently identifying overlapping nodes that satisfy the above condition.

 abstract = {Network communities represent basic structures for understanding the organization of real-world networks. A community (also referred to as a module or a cluster) is typically thought of as a group of nodes with more connections amongst its members than between its members and the remainder of the network. Communities in networks also overlap as nodes belong to multiple clusters at once. Due to the difficulties in evaluating the detected communities and the lack of scalable algorithms, the task of overlapping community detection in large networks largely remains an open problem.
In this paper we present BIGCLAM (Cluster Affiliation Model for Big Networks), an overlapping community detection method that scales to large networks of millions of nodes and edges. We build on a novel observation that overlaps between communities are densely connected. This is in sharp contrast with present community detection methods which implicitly assume that overlaps between communities are sparsely connected and thus cannot properly extract overlapping communities in networks. In this paper, we develop a model-based community detection algorithm that can detect densely overlapping, hierarchically nested as well as non-overlapping communities in massive networks. We evaluate our algorithm on 6 large social, collaboration and information networks with ground-truth community information. Experiments show state of the art performance both in terms of the quality of detected communities as well as in speed and scalability of our algorithm.},

 abstract = {Graphs or networks can be used to model complex systems. Detecting community structures from large network data is a classic and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel community detection algorithm, which utilizes a dynamic process by contradicting the network topology and the topology-based propinquity, where the propinquity. is a measure of the probability for a pair of nodes involved in a coherent community structure. Through several rounds of mutual reinforcement between topology and propinquity, the community structures are expected to naturally emerge. The overlapping vertices shared between communities can also be easily identified by an additional simple post-processing. To achieve better efficiency, the propinquity is incrementally calculated. We implement the algorithm on a vertex-oriented bulk synchronous parallel(BSP) model so that the mining load can be distributed on thousands of machines. We obtained interesting experimental results on several real network data.},

 abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

characteristic travel distance and a significant
probability to return to a few highly frequented

distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory,
the individual travel patterns collapse into a single
spatial probability distribution, indicating that,
despite the diversity of their travel history, humans
follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent

Uncovering this community structure is one of the most important problems in the field of complex networks. Networks often show a hierarchical organization, with communities embedded within other communities; moreover, nodes can be shared between different communities. Here we present the first algorithm that finds both overlapping communities and the hierarchical structure. The method is based on the local optimization of a fitness function. Community structure is revealed by peaks in the fitness histogram. The resolution can be tuned by a parameter enabling to investigate different hierarchical levels of organization.

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible ``betweenness'' measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

Here we examine the communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole. We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency-the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.},

 abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

This problem is relevant for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries (functional studies in metabolic and protein networks), or technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types of algorithms exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a general and quantitative definition of community is not implemented in the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results without any additional nontopological information. In this article we deal with this problem by showing how quantitative definitions of community are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how the algorithm applies to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, cannot be attacked with the usual methods. This type of local algorithm could open the way to applications to large-scale technological and biological systems.},
