The first public version, a real alpha-book, of the Open Augmented Reality
Teaching Book is available. 

The book is both for students learning about mixed reality and for teachers seeking inspiration for the design of courses.

The content is far from being complete. We have four different badges for 
signaling the maturity of content.

{% include badge.html base=pathToRoot badgeName="todo" %} means there is noting but the chapter to
{% include badge.html base=pathToRoot badgeName="outline" %}  means someone has started to take care about the chapter
{% include badge.html base=pathToRoot badgeName="inProgress" %} means someone is writing and waiting on comments
{% include badge.html base=pathToRoot badgeName="complete" %} means someone has finished writing but is still waiting on comments
