title:  "Welcome to the Open Augmented Reality Teaching Book"
---

The first public version, a real alpha-book, of the Open Augmented Reality
Teaching Book is available. 

The book is both for students learning about mixed reality and for teachers seeking inspiration for the design of courses.

The content is far from being complete. We have four different badges for 
signaling the maturity of content.

status:todo means there is noting but the chapter to
status:outline means someone has started to take care about the chapter
status:in progress means someone is writing and waiting on comments
status:complete means someone has finished writing but is still waiting on comments
