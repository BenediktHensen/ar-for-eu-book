# Preface of the book

The AR-FOR-EU book is the compiled documentation of several courses the AR-FOR-EU consortium put together and gave at
several occasions. The purpose of the book is to give course organizers the necessary materials to compile their own courses
for mixed reality education at higher education institutions aka universities.

We like to thank the many contributors of this open educational book about augmented reality.

We like to thank the AR-FOR-EU project for the generous support of the book.
