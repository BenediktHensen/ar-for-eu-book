# History of AR

Different sources trace the history of augmented reality back to the beginning of the 20th century, but it can be said that seminal work was done in the 1960s by Ivan Sutherlands and others. The term augmented reality however was coined by Thomas P. Caudellin the 80s according to [^1] (Lee, Kangdon (March 2012). "Augmented Reality in Education and Training" (PDF). Techtrends: Linking Research & Practice to Improve Learning. 56 (2).)
