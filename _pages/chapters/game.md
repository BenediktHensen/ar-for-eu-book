## Game Design

### Elements

#### Quests

#### Points

Points are a basic element to reward a player's performance in games.
Players gain points for the successful completion of tasks.

Points can be integrated with more complex systems as a progress indicator or currency.
For instance, players can use the points as a currency, e.g. to buy virtual items or unlock nodes in skill trees.
Additionally, level systems, leader boards and high scores rely on points to indicate the progress and performance of the player.

#### Levels

Levels group players based on their success and progress in a game.
Generic levels are labelled numerically, starting at level 1, and increase with the player's progress.
However, levels can also be named according to the general story of the game, e.g. "Apprentice" or "Master Magician".

Levels can have different purposes.
In single player games they can determine the difficulty of the player's computer-controlled opponents.
For instance, difficult quests only become available once the player has reached a certain level.
This avoids that an inexperienced user gets frustrated with the game by facing a demanding task early on.
The difficulty of the game can increase while the player levels up based on the assumption that the user got acquainted to the game's mechanics and controls.
Multiplayer games can implement a matchmaking logic which avoids that low-level beginners have to play against experienced players on a higher level.
This is again a mean to minimize frustration and balance the difficulty.

Apart from this, levels can also act as a form of motivation.

#### Highscores & Leaderboards



#### Achievements

Achievements are virtual trophies.
They are used in games to credit players with completing special tasks in the game.
Achievements can be issued for finishing parts of the game, for succeeding in optional quests or for collecting special items.
In addition to this, achievements are used to reward players for finding easter eggs, like hidden secrets and jokes in the video game.
Achievements can e.g. be found on the game platforms of Valve (Steam), Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (PlayStation), Apple (iOS) and Google (Android) {% cite BaMi17 %}.
These platforms provide developers with APIs which can be used to integrate these achievements in the games.

#### Badges

Similar to achievements, games can also issue badges to the player.

#### Progress Bars

#### Stories

## Gamification

Gamification describes the concept of using elements from game design in other applications to motivate the user {%cite DDKN11 %}.

### Gamification Service

### Examples

#### Pokemon Go

#### GaMR

#### Open Badges

## Serious Games

In contrast to gamification, serious games do not only use single game elements but are complete games.
These games have been designed with a serious goal in mind, e.g. to convey information during the gameplay.
