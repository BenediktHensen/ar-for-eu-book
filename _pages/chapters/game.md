## Game Design

### Elements

#### Points

Points are a basic element to reward a player's performance in games.
Players gain points for the successful completion of tasks.

Points can be integrated with more complex systems as a progress indicator or currency.
For instance, players can use the points as a currency, e.g. to buy virtual items or unlock nodes in skill trees.
Additionally, level systems, leader boards and high scores rely on points to indicate the progress and performance of the player.

#### Levels

Levels group players based on their success and progress in a game.
Generic levels are labelled numerically, starting at level 1, and increase with the player's progress.
However, levels can also be named according to the general story of the game, e.g. "Apprentice" or "Master Magician".

Levels can have different purposes.
In single player games they can determine the difficulty of the player's computer-controlled opponents.
For instance, difficult quests only become available once the player has reached a certain level.
This avoids that an inexperienced user gets frustrated with the game by facing a demanding task early on.
The difficulty of the game can increase while the player levels up based on the assumption that the user got acquainted to the game's mechanics and controls.
Multiplayer games can implement a matchmaking logic which avoids that low-level beginners have to play against experienced players on a higher level.
This is again a mean to minimize frustration and balance the difficulty.

Apart from this, levels can also act as a form of motivation.

#### Highscores & Leaderboards

Highscores and leaderboards are used in games to create social competition.
Players become aware of each other and can compare their own performance to others.
The highscore describes the best result any player has every achieved.
More player results are available on highscore tables which show the top results of the best **n** players.
In contrast to this, leaderboards are similar to a league system.
There can be multilple tiers in which participants can challenge each other to matches.
If the lower-ranked person wins, the two opponents switch places in the ranking.
Otherwise, the ranking stays as it is and the lower-ranked person may not challenge the same opponent again for some time.
Highscore tables enable passive competition whereas leaderboards create active competition.
With highscores, people play on their own and try to beat the current highscore.
To progress on leaderboards, the participants are acutally playing against one another.

#### Achievements

Achievements are virtual trophies.
They are used in games to credit players with completing special tasks in the game.
Achievements can be issued for finishing parts of the game, for succeeding in optional quests or for collecting special items.
In addition to this, achievements are used to reward players for finding easter eggs, like hidden secrets and jokes in the video game.
Achievements can e.g. be found on the game platforms of Valve (Steam), Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (PlayStation), Apple (iOS) and Google (Android) {% cite BaMi17 %}.
These platforms provide developers with APIs which can be used to integrate these achievements in the games.

#### Badges

Similar to achievements, games can also issue badges to the player.

#### Progress Bars

Progress bars indicate the general progression of a task or a set of tasks.
Whereas general applications use progress bars to indicate how far a computer has come in a computation or loading process, games apply progress bars to show the player's progression.
The progress bar is influenced and filled by actions which are performed by the user.
This way, it acts as a tool to provide feedback and motivation to the user.
It focuses the user's attention on a goal which can be reached after completing all necessary tasks.

#### Quests

## Gamification

Gamification describes the concept of using elements from game design in other applications to motivate the user {%cite DDKN11 %}.

### Gamification Service

### Open Badges

The Open Badges project is a gamified certification system by the Mozilla Foundation.
It allows website developers to issue badges to its visitors for performing certain tasks.
The system is designed in a way that the badges are standardized so that they can be collected on different sites and from different institutions.
Badges are e.g. used by schools, universities or in online MOOCS to certify the attendance to courses or the acquisition of a certain skill.
The badges are added to the user's inventory and can be displayed to others, e.g. in a CV.
Users who view the badge can verify that it is valid due to a certification and credential system.
The badges consist of an image which is stored as a PNG-file.
In addition to this, meta data can be added to ship more information with the badge.

### Examples

#### Duolingo

### AR Examples

#### Pokemon Go

#### GaMR

## Serious Games

In contrast to gamification, serious games do not only use single game elements but are complete games.
These games have been designed with a serious goal in mind, e.g. to convey information during the gameplay.
