# WebXR

WebXR (Mixed Reality on the Web) superseded WebVR in 2018. The [W3c editor's draft] (https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/)
gives details on the WebXR Device API.
WebXR is an extension of the WebVR API covering augmented reality devices in the JavaScript API. 
The new API has two goals.
First, it enhances the possibilities for new input devices like for gesture and speech recognition.
This gives to user new options to navigate and interact in the virtual environment.
Second, it gives a technical platform to create augmented reality content.
Moreover, it tackles incompabilities of the predecessor with different browsers like Safari and Chrome. 
The amount of code needed to create virtual experiences on different devices should be reduced,
A number of browsers is already supporting WebXR.
